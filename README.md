# Status Checklists

Close or reopen an Issue based on whether all checklists are checked.

Example:

```md
This is a master issue that requires the following be completed:

- [ ] Design the thing
- [ ] Write some code
- [ ] Ship it!
```

Once all three items are checked:

```md
This is a master issue that requires the following be completed:

- [x] Design the thing
- [x] Write some code
- [x] Ship it!
```

Then the issue will be marked ‚ùå **Closed**. Unchecking will reopen the issue.
